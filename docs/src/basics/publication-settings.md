# Publication Settings

After installing the theme you will most likely want to configure the following basic settings in your publication:

## Title & Description

In the **General Settings** of the Ghost Admin you can change the name of your publication and enter a description, as you can see in the following screenshot:

The theme uses this information in a variety of places, for example in the first section of the home page, so if you want to display other content in that section, these are the settings you will need to change.

## Social Accounts

Ghost allows you to add social accounts links for **Facebook** and **Twitter**. By default it includes links from their own social accounts.

To change these links just delete them and enter yours in the **Social Accounts** section at the bottom of the **General Settings** page:

If you don't want to show Facebook and Twitter links just delete the default links and save the changes.

## Branding

In the **Branding Settings** of the Ghost Admin you can change the Publication icon and the Publication logo as well.

### Accent Color

This is the primary color that the theme uses to highlight certain elements such as buttons, indicators, hover states and others. To change the color you can enter a hexadecimal value or you can click on the small square that appears in the options to select it visually.

For example, Galerie uses `#121212` as the primary color in the live demo.

Galerie also offers the option to set the accent color for the dark mode in case it doesn't quite blend well. You can set the accent color for dark mode in the theme design settings as shown below:

::: warning
The accent color for dark mode is only available if you're using Ghost 4.20.0 or later and Galerie 1.1.0 or later.

### Publication Icon

The icon or _favicon_ is a small image that can be seen in the browser tab, next to the title. You can change the icon in this section.

### Publication Logo

Ghost by default includes a white logo, I recommend you to remove it and upload your own logo. You can do this in the **Publication logo** field located in this section.

If your logo does not look good in dark mode, you can upload an additional logo to be displayed when dark mode is activated. You can upload your second logo in the theme design settings as shown below:

::: tip
If you don't upload a logo the theme will use the title of your publication as logo, which will be displayed correctly in both light mode and dark mode.
:::

::: warning
The second logo option is only available if you're using Ghost 4.20.0 or later and Galerie 1.1.0 or later.

### Publication Cover

You can also change the cover which is shown in the first section of the home page. To change it just delete the default image in the **Publication Cover** field and upload the image you want.

Here's a screenshot of these settings:
