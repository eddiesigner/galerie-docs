# Update Theme

Before installing a new version of this theme please do not forget to **make a backup** of the version you are currently using.

**If you have not modified any files** in the theme folder previously, you can simply upload the new file `galerie.zip` in the Ghost Admin and that's it.

However, **if you have made changes to some files previously**, you must apply those changes to the files in the folder corresponding to the latest version, otherwise **your changes will be overwritten**.

::: tip
Sometimes stylesheets or javascript files are updated, this means that if you want to update the theme, you will also have to replace the `assets` folder as it contains the updated styles and scripts. This folder is completely rebuilt in each new version so you can simply replace it to apply possible new changes in styles and scripts.

::: tip
If you want to make small changes to the theme (e.g. styles), it is best to make them directly in the Ghost Admin so they can be persisted.
