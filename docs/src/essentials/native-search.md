# Native Search

As of Ghost 5.30.0 it's now possible to use the brand new native search functionality, you can learn more about it here: [ghost.org/changelog/search/](https://ghost.org/changelog/search/)

This feature is not enabled by default, if you prefer the native search over the custom search provided by the theme you have to enable it in the theme settings under the **Site-wide** section:

Please note that unlike the theme custom search, **you don't need to generate a Content API Key** in order to make it work, you can leave that field as it is.

::: warning
This option is only available if you're using Ghost 5.30.0 or later and Galerie 2.1.0 or later.
