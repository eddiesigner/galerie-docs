# Comments

## Native Comments

[Native commenting](https://ghost.org/changelog/native-comments/) support was introduced in Ghost 5.9.0 and it's supported by the theme from version 2.1.0, this feature allows you to invite members to join the discussion and participate in a community directly on your website.

This feature is disabled by default, if you want to use it you have to enable it first, you can do it in the Ghost Admin, under the **Membership** settings:

If you want to implement anonymous commenting, require other advanced commenting features, keep reading.

## Third-party Comments

Galerie is also compatible with third-party solutions, you can use any of the available [Ghost integrations](https://ghost.org/integrations/?tag=community), the installation is usually quite simple, below you can see an example of how to add Disqus and Cove comments to your blog. The setup process for other solutions is pretty much the same.

### Disqus

Galerie integrates perfectly with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), all you have to do is the following:

1. After creating an account in Disqus, you have to create a new site in the [admin](https://disqus.com/admin) of that platform

2. You must copy the **shortname** of your brand new site, this can be found in the preferences of your site

3. Unzip the theme folder

4. Open the file `partials/comments.hbs` with a text editor and comment out the following lines of code:

```html
{{!--
<section class="g-post-comments">
  <div class="g-post-comments__wrapper js-comments">
    <!-- Paste here the provided code snippet -->
  </div>
</section>
--}}
```

5. Now replace `<!-- Paste here the provided code snippet -->` with this:

```html
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>
  var disqus_config = function () {
    this.page.url = "{{url absolute="true"}}";
    this.page.identifier = "ghost-{{comment_id}}"
  };
  (function () {
    var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'https://CHANGETHIS.disqus.com/embed.js';
    s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
    (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
  })();
</script>
```

6. Then look for the following line of code:

```js
s.src = 'https://CHANGE_THIS.disqus.com/embed.js';
```

Replace `CHANGE_THIS` with the **shortname** you got in step 2

7. Finally save the file, zip the theme folder and upload it again

### Cove

[Cove](https://cove.chat/) is an alternative comment platform that allows you to embed fully functional comment threads from your subscribed members, allowing you to build a community for your membership audience on Ghost. In other words, Cove lets subscribers of your content log in and comment on your content.

There is an [official guide](https://ghost.org/integrations/cove-comments/) on how to integrate Cove with Ghost, the only difference is step 4 (Add the code to your theme), the difference is that you have to replace all the content of `partials/comments.hbs` with the following piece of code:

```html
{{#if @labs.members}}
  <section class="g-post-comments">
    <div class="g-post-comments__wrapper">
      <h2><span id="cove-count"></span> Comments</h2>
      <div id="cove"></div>

      {{#if @member}}
        <p>Signed in as {{@member.email}} Â· <a href="javascript:" data-members-signout>Sign out</a></p>
      {{else}}
        <p>Become a {{@site.title}} member below to join the conversation (it's free!). As a member, you will also receive new posts by email (you can unsubscribe at any time).</p>
        <form data-members-form="signin" id="cove-login">
          <input class="cove-input" data-members-email type="email" required="true" placeholder="your@email.com" />
          <button type="submit" class="cove-button">Sign in to comment</button>
          <span class="signin-success" style="display:none">Great! Please check your inbox for a log in link.</span>
          <span class="signin-error" style="display:none">Something didn't work. Please try again.</span>
        </form>
      {{/if}}

      <script>
      const Cove = {
        publication: "your_site_id",
        contentId: "{{id}}",
        memberId: "{{@member.uuid}}",
        memberEmail: "{{@member.email}}"
      }
      </script>
    </div>
  </section>
{{/if}}
```

Finally save the file, zip the theme folder and upload it again.

For more detailed info please refer to their [official documentation](https://cove.chat/help/install-cove-in-ghost/).
