# Table of Contents

Galerie supports Table Of Contents in posts right out of the box, you can see a demo [here](https://galerie.eduardogomez.io/interview-with-daina-lightfoot-galerie-magazine/), it looks like this:

![TOC](https://res.cloudinary.com/edev/image/upload/v1633182966/galerie/toc.png)

If you want to enable it in certain posts you can do it as follows:

1. Open a post in the Ghost Admin.

2. Open the post settings and scroll all the way down.

3. Select **Toc** as the template:
